### Introdution

For the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics certificate, I
have chosen the Cyclistic bike share data to work on. For the case
study, I will perform real-world tasks of a junior data analyst for the
marketing team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.
To answer key business questions, I will follow the six steps of the
data analysis process : Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

### The scenario

The director of marketing of Cyclistic, Lily Moreno, believes that the
company's future growth depends on maximizing the number of annual
memberships. Hence, the marketing analyst team wants to understand how
casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From
these insights, the analytics team could be able to design a new
marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Three questions will guide the future marketing campaign:

1.How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes
differently?

2.Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3.How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to
become members?

I have been assigned by Moreno the first question.

### The Ask phase

-   A statement of the business task:

According to Cyclistic, annual members are far more profitable than
casual riders. Therefore, our goal is to develop marketing strategies
and a campaign that will enable us to turn casual riders into annual
members.

-   My key stakeholders are:

1-Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno has
initiated this strategy.

2-The executive team: For business task to be implemented, the executive
team must approve our recommendations, which must be supported by
compelling data insights. and professional data visualizations.

### The Prepare phase

**Data Source:** Original bike share data set from 27/06/2013 to
31/10/2022 was extracted as 55 zipped .csv
[files](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data is
made available and licensed by Motivate International Inc under this
[license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

**Data Organization & Description:**

File naming convention: YYYY_MM

File Type: csv format

File Content: Each csv file consist of 13 columns which contain
information related to ride id, rider type, ride start and end time,
start and end location etc. Number of rows varies between 49k to 531k
from different excel files.

**Data credibility:**

-   The data set is reliable, the data is complete and accurate for the
    chosen time window.

-   The data is original, it is a first arty information.

-   The data is comprehensive, the data set contains all information
    needed to answer the question.

-   The data is accurate, rider data of the last 9 Years and 4 months
    was used.

-   The data is cited and vetted by Chicago department of
    transportation.

**Data Security:**

-   Riders' personal identifiable information is hidden through
    tokenization.

-   Original files are backed up in a separate folder.

**Data Limitations:**

As riders' personal identifiable information is hidden, thus will not be
able to connect pass purchases to credit cards numbers to determine if
casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have
purchased multiple single passes.

### The Process Phase

I used Excel, SQL and R for data verification and cleaning: Reasons: The
55 data sets combined will contain more than 14 million rows of data.
Excel worksheet limitation is 1,048,576 rows. Moreover, some csv files
could not uploaded to BigQuery for file size problems. Thus, R is used
to perform all tasks from organizing, cleaning analyzing and visualizing
data.

Organizing Data.

I have use Excel to merge some files.

We will Combine the 2nd Quarter data from 2016 month 04,05,06 through
Microsoft Excel.

![](images/Exicuting%20Merge%20Query%20Q2%202016.JPG)

We also require to merge the data of 2015 Q3 month 07,08,09 this time we
will use SQL to do so.

![](images/Merging%202015%20Q3%20in%20SQLite.JPG)

Now we have all the file with appropriate formats in a folder to start
merging to one main file in R.

### The Analyze Phase

#### Setting up the environment

Here, I use several libraries that help reading, cleaning, organizing
and analyzing the data.

```{r libraries, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(data.table)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(metR)
```

#### Importing data

Cyclistic data data set from 27/06/2013 to 31/10/2022 was extracted as
55 .csv files.

```{r merge_all_files, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

library(data.table)

setwd("D:/Lerning/Potfolio Projects/Google Data Capstone/TRACK 1/Bicycle Study/Project Data/All_CSV_files")

#We will make a list of all files which we want to merge.
files <- list.files(pattern = ".csv")
temp <- lapply(files,fread,sep=",")
merged_data <- rbindlist(temp,use.names = TRUE ,fill = TRUE)
print(done)
dir(path ="D:/Lerning/Potfolio Projects/Google Data Capstone/TRACK 1/Bicycle Study/Project Data/All_CSV_files")
write.csv(merged_data,file = "CYCLISTIC_DATA",row.names = FALSE)
```

Now we have a add data merged .CSV file which we can use in other tools
to or archive it to avoid future merging of all files.

Afterwards, the 55 data sets are combined into one big data frame of
14284922 observations.

```{r Load_csv, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

library(readr)

setwd("D:/Lerning/Potfolio Projects/Google Data Capstone/TRACK 1/Bicycle Study/Project Data/Sql files")
CYCLISTIC_DATA <- read_csv("CYCLISTIC_DATA.csv")
```

#### Clean up and organize data to prepare for analysis

Inspect the new table that has been created.

```{r CYCLISTIC_DATA inspection, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
colnames(CYCLISTIC_DATA)  #List of column names
dim(CYCLISTIC_DATA)  #Dimensions of the data frame
head(CYCLISTIC_DATA)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame
str(CYCLISTIC_DATA)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
```

Then, columns that list the date, month, day, day_of_week and year of
each ride are added. days of the week are assigned the numbers 1:Monday,
2:Tuesday, etc. This will allow the aggregation of the data by each day,
month or day_of_week.

```{r separting ride date and extracting date data, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA$date <- as.Date(CYCLISTIC_DATA$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
CYCLISTIC_DATA$month <- format(as.Date(CYCLISTIC_DATA$date), "%m")
CYCLISTIC_DATA$day <- format(as.Date(CYCLISTIC_DATA$date), "%d")
CYCLISTIC_DATA$year <- format(as.Date(CYCLISTIC_DATA$date), "%Y")
CYCLISTIC_DATA$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(CYCLISTIC_DATA$date), "%u") #"%A" would deliver names of weekdays
```

Add a "ride_length" calculation to CYCLISTIC_DATA in seconds and in
minutes (2 new columns).

```{r calulate the ride_length in secs, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length <- difftime(CYCLISTIC_DATA$ended_at,CYCLISTIC_DATA$started_at)
CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length_m <- (difftime(CYCLISTIC_DATA$ended_at,CYCLISTIC_DATA$started_at))/60
```

Inspect the structure of the newly added columns.

```{r data inspection, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
str(CYCLISTIC_DATA)
```

Convert c(ride_length, ride_length_m, day and month) to numeric so that
calculation can be executed.

```{r converting variables to numeric, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length))
CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length_m <- as.numeric(as.character(CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length_m))
CYCLISTIC_DATA$month <- as.numeric(CYCLISTIC_DATA$month)
CYCLISTIC_DATA$day <- as.numeric(CYCLISTIC_DATA$day)
is.numeric(CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length)
is.numeric(CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length_m)
is.numeric(CYCLISTIC_DATA$month)
is.numeric(CYCLISTIC_DATA$day)
```

After converting and inspecting data, it was noticed that
col:ride_length has some negative values, probably because start_time
and end_time were swapped for these rides, or the system simply
registered and recorded the rides incorrectly. So, negative-seconds
rides must be excluded.

```{r droppig rows, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1 <- CYCLISTIC_DATA[!( CYCLISTIC_DATA$ride_length < 0),]
```

#### First analysis step: descriptive analysis on ride length

First of all, a descriptive analysis on ride length [min] is performed.

```{r data statistical summary, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1 %>% 
  summarise(max(ride_length_m),min(ride_length_m),mean(ride_length_m)) 
```

The overall average ride length is 22.732 minutes.

Second, the mode of weekday is calculated, namely which weekday occurs
the most or on which weekday most bike are rented.

```{r plot1: mode of the week_day, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
  CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1 %>% 
  group_by(day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides)) + geom_col()+
geom_text(aes(label = signif(number_of_rides)),nudge_y = 3 )
```

The plot shows that most rides were started on Friday(20,66,960 rides),
Saturday(24,74,800 rides) followed by Sunday(21,07,990 rides). So most
bikes are rented on the weekend.

Next, a plot of the ride_length or average_duration in minutes for every
day of the week for members and casual riders is shown.

```{r plot2: ride_length per day per rider type, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_m)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, day_of_week)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

The plot demonstrates that casual riders rent bikes for longer
durations, especially on Sunday, Saturday, Friday (weekend) and on
Monday. Members show a steady riding/using behavior, plus they also tend
to ride a little longer on the weekend.

Here, number of rides per day for every rider type is plotted.

```{r plot3: number_of_rides per day per rider type, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length_m)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, day_of_week)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

Surprisingly, and in contrast to the former plot, members begin more
rides and thus have higher number of rides on every day of the week
except for Saturday and Sunday (Weekend).

#### Second analysis step: average ride length depending on rider type and number of each rider type

```{r plot4: mean ride lenght, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1 %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(max(ride_length_m), min(ride_length_m),avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length_m)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = member_casual, y = avg_ride_length,fill=member_casual)) +
  geom_col()+ geom_text(aes(label = signif(avg_ride_length)),nudge_y = 3 ) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 40, by = 5))
```

So, the result shows that casual riders tend to rent bikes for longer
mean durations than members (34.6 min to 13.9 min), in accordance with
plot 2. Members probably use bikes to commute, whereas casual riders
maybe, among other things, exercising, visiting the city or attending
special events.

Here, the overall rider count based on rider type is plotted

```{r plot5: overall rider count by rider type, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1 %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(rider_count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = member_casual, y = rider_count,fill=member_casual )) + geom_col()+geom_text(aes(label = signif(rider_count)),nudge_y = 3 )
```

The plot indicates that more than 3/4 of all riders are member riders.

#### Third analysis step: Exploring effect of seasonality

Here, the Function "season" of the library "metR" was used to assign
season to months:

DJF:winter

MAM:Spring

JJA:Summer

SON:Fall

```{r assigning season to months}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1$season <- season(CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1$month)
```

First, let us consider number of rides and ride length by weekday on
each season

```{r plot6: number of rides by week_day and rider type and season, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1%>%
  group_by(season, day_of_week, member_casual) %>%   
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()						 
  ,avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length_m)) %>% 
ggplot() + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual), position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~season) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 400000, by = 100000))
```

```{r plot7: ride_lenght by week_day and rider type and season, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1%>%
  group_by(season, day_of_week, member_casual) %>%   
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()						 
  ,avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length_m)) %>% 
ggplot() + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = day_of_week, y = avg_ride_length, fill = member_casual), position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~season) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 50, by = 10))
```

Plot 6 tells us that number of rides of members is always higher than
that of casual riders on every work day in every season. Weekends are
still the time where casual riders bike more than members. The only
exception of this trend is in the winter months (Dec, Jan, Feb). Plot 7
demonstrates that the member group has all year long the average ride
length of about 13.9 minutes. Casual riders use bikes about half an hour
long on all days in spring and summer. In winter and fall, the average
ride lengths becomes less than 30 minutes.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--

Lastly, let us generate a line plot for continuous change of number of
rides along the whole year for the two rider types.

```{r plot8: number of rides along the whole year}
CYCLISTIC_DATA_v1%>%
  group_by(month, member_casual) %>%   
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()						 
  ,avg_ride_length = mean(ride_length_m)) %>% 
ggplot() + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = month, y = number_of_rides, color = member_casual)) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, by = 1))
```

The plot indicates, for casual riders/members, ridership peaked around
July/August (Summer months being the turning point) and hit the lowest
at December/February before rebounding up swiftly and continuously.

### The Share phase

#### Conclusions/Summary of insights

The amount of time, frequency, and days of the week on which each group
peaks varies between members and casual riders:

-   Weekends are busiest for casual rides (plot3). It's very likely that
    they are city visitors who are visiting the sights, or that they are
    regular Chicago residents who are enjoying a weekend bike ride. This
    is supported by the fact that the average ride time for casual
    riders (plot2) is longer and increases on weekends.

-   Members typically ride for a shorter period of time than casual
    riders. This could be clarified by saying that the majority of the
    members commute to work on bicycles. This clarification would also
    shed light on why members only ride for brief periods of time. They
    travel daily commute, which is roughly the same distance and ride
    length every time.

-   (Plot 8). shows that ridership begins to increase in February (from
    Spring through Summer) and that it then begins to decline in August
    (from Fall through winter). The seasonal changes are what cause this
    correlation. More people begin to cycle as the weather begins to
    warm up and become more pleasant in February (the beginning of
    Spring), and the opposite is true as the weather turns cold and less
    pleasant around September (start of Fall).

-   More than 50% of the riders (plot 5) are annual members, indicating
    that the business has already attained a certain level of customer
    loyalty. This suggests a positive message, namely that the company
    will be able to persuade many casual riders to become members and to
    maintain the satisfaction of the new members.

#### Recommendations

A casual rider's usage pattern differs from that of a member's, and
every group peaks at different times of week.

-   Since the number of trips taken by casual riders peaks between March
    and August, this is the best time of year to launch the marketing
    campaign.

-   Weekend-only membership can be included in the marketing campaign at
    a reasonable price because weekend usage by casual riders is at its
    peak. This might entice causal to become member riders.

-   To draw in more casual riders, familiarise them with the brand, and
    encourage them to become members, the campaign might include
    ride-length-based events from February to August.

-   Alternately, longer rides can be rewarded with advantages like gift
    cards for discounts.
